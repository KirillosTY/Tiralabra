# Weekly reports
Each weeks report will be found here with all the relevant information.

## week 1
Hours used: 6.

Found an subject that interested me( compressing) and read about Huffman and LZ77 coding. Made the specification document and just the basic structure for the project. 

Next week: Starting the fundamentals of Huffman coding.


## week 2
Hours used: 10.

Tried to implement the Huffman compressing algorithms, which worked fine, but writing it as binary to a file proved to be annoying. 
Managed to do the start of the job: first 64 bits are reserved for the size of the file --> 
+ treebuilding: 8 bits to count how many characters there are + 8 bits for the chars themselves + 8 bits for the length of the binary + 16 bits for the binary itself.
I have an vague idea how to read the huffman tree from these and decode, wont be ready on time though.
Also added checkstyle and Jacoco and some tests. 


## week 4
Hours used: 15.
Currently all tests for encoding and decoding is done. It also works fine for any ASCII containing text file. Next up is a fast build of a simple file chooser GUI and then moving onto ziv lempel algorithm. Im a week behind, but will be catching up this and next week hopefully.
