# Project Specification 

This project will be used to study different compressing algorightms targeting for a lossless compressing for text files of various kind. 
This will be done using Java 11. 

## Algorithms and datastructures
The algorithms used for this study will be Huffman, that uses the a binary tree for compressing and LZ 77. 

## Input and Output

Accepted inputs for starters will be any text file and output a compressed copy of it, containing the same information in smaller package.
 
 
 
 ### Personal info
 I´m studying for a bachelor in computer science. I´ve mostly used Java, but will be picking up python along the way. The reason I have chosen this project is that compressing just happened to intrigue me.
